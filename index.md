## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Theoretical Chemistry Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have got my B.S. in Chemistry at Peking University. I believe that a sophisticated integration of physics-based and machine learning methods can effectively expand our knowledge of complex molecular systems, especially those in living systems.

## Research Interests

- **Molecular Simulation:** biomolecular dynamics, enhanced sampling methods.
- **Machine Learning:** graph learning, generative models.

## News

- **[Sep. 2024]** I can't give you a definite answer at the moment.
