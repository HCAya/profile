## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Theoretical Chemistry Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison. I completed my B.S. in Chemistry at Peking University. My research focuses on the rational integration of physics-based and machine learning methods to deepen our understanding of complex molecular systems, particularly those in living systems. I am also deeply interested in the multiscale emergent phenomena in nature.

This is the second paragraph.

## Research Interests

- **Molecular Simulation:** biomolecular dynamics, enhanced sampling methods.
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning on graphs, generative models.

## News

- **[Oct. 2024]** The manuscript *DSDPFlex: Flexible-Receptor Docking with GPU Acceleration* is accepted by *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling* (JCIM)
- **[Sep. 2024]** I can't give you a definite answer at the moment.
